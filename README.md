🎮 Simon Game – Memory Challenge Web Application

An interactive Simon Game built as a web application that challenges users to test and improve their memory skills by repeating an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in JavaScript logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation, delivered through an engaging and responsive user interface.

📌 Project Overview

The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where players must observe and replicate a sequence generated by the system. With each successful level, the sequence grows longer, increasing the difficulty and testing the user’s concentration and recall ability.

This project focuses on implementing event-driven programming and game state management using JavaScript, along with dynamic UI updates and audio feedback to enhance the gameplay experience.

✨ Features

Random sequence generation with increasing difficulty

Level-based progression system

Keyboard-based game start

Interactive sound and visual feedback

Real-time user input validation

Automatic game-over detection and restart functionality

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure and layout

CSS – Styling, animations, and visual feedback

JavaScript – Game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation

jQuery – Simplified DOM interactions and event management

⚙️ How the Game Works

The game starts when the user presses a key

A random color is added to the sequence

The user must repeat the sequence in the correct order

Each correct attempt advances the game to the next level

An incorrect input triggers a game-over state and allows restart

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Implementing game logic using JavaScript

Managing game state and level progression

Handling keyboard and click events

Using DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates

Integrating audio and visual feedback in web applications
